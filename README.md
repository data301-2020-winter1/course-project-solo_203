## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The topic that will be in the center of this project the accuracy of will be soccer matches predictions. Several agencies, for years now, have been predicting soccer matches outcomes using specific datasets. However, soccer is a sport full of surprises and unpredictable outcomes. My job, with my analytics project, will be to properly dissect all these predictions and their actual outcomesin order to tell if individuals should really trust soccer matches predictors. I am interested in this topic because soccer is one of my passion. I am very interested in the sport itself, and I wanted to combine my passion for the sport and data analytics. By the end of this project, I wish the answer the questions of whether football can actually be predictable, and does the strongest team always more likely to win?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset is from fivethirtyeight. 
The dataset is a collection of around 10,000 soccer games that were played between 2016 and 2018. The dataset consists of score predictions that were done by the agency that created the dataset. They predicted scores of various games using different data to create an SPI (Strength Power Index) for each team, and then predicted the final outcomes of games using the SPI as the main reference of their predictions.
